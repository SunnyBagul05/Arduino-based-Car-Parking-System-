# Arduino-based-Car-Parking-System-

This is our Second year PBL project.
We have used an Arduino UNO, IR Sensors, Servo motors and a LCD display for the project.


Setup Instructions
1. Install latest Arduino IDE
2. When setup is complete, install libraries. 
.. For Libraries: https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries
.. Navigate to your Arduino IDE Install Directory
.. It can be " C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries " or wherever you have installed 
.. Place Library FOLDERS in this directory.

.. You will need the following libraries. 
..... LiquidCrystal_I2C
..... InfraredSensoresTEP

3. Open the "parking_code" code.
4. Plug in your Arduino UNO. Windows may install drivers if this is the first time
5. Select the apropraite board and port
6. Upload code. 
7. Now connect all the components to the Arduino UNO and check for Working.
